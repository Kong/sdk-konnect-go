# Release process

In order to release a new version of the SDK, follow these steps:

- submit a PR with OpenAPI spec changes that you want to get released
- label the PR with a version type that you want to release (e.g. `major`, `minor`, `patch`)
- wait for the CI to generate new SDK version
- review the changes and merge the PR
- wait for new release to be published
