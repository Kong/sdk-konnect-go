  x-extensions-note: >
    This API uses the `x-expression` vendor extension to indicate that a string
    property is a DSL expression.

    Supported types:



      - `boolean`: An expression evaluates to boolean. For example, `context.topic.name == 'my-topic'`
      - `string`: A template string expression that evaluates to a string or a literal string value. For example,
        `${context.topic.name.substring(0, context.topic.name.length-4)}` or `my-literal-value`

    Additionally, `x-sensitive` flag indicates that a field contains sensitive
    information. When the value

    of the field is provided in plain text, it's encrypted at rest and it's
    never returned in API responses.

    When the value is an expression, the expression itself is stored and
    returned in API responses.

      Create and maintain a centralized catalog of all services running in your
      organization.

      Add custom fields and map resources from across your organization to
      provide a 360-degree overview of your services.


      Custom fields allow you to surface key information such as:

      - `Owner`: The person or team responsible for the service

      - `Product Manager`: The person assigned to guide the service's direction
      for customer success

      - `Jira Project`: The Jira project which represents past, present and
      future work for the service


      Resources are discovered from the integrations you use within your
      organization to create, operate and manage your services.

      Mapping the resources relevant to your service will provide a rich view of
      the service's communication channels, dependencies and more.

      Types of resources which you can map to a service include:

      - `Code Repositories:` The software project(s) that make up the service

      - `Monitors and Dashboards:` Tools providing visibility into the health
      and performance of the service

      - `Communication Channels`: Virtual spaces where questions and concerns
      can be raised about the service

      - `Incident Management Resources`: Alerts setup within your incident
      management platform to notify individuals regarding issues with the
      service
  - name: Catalog Integrations
    description: >
      Integrations are applications, either Konnect-internal or external, which
      extend the functionality of the Service Catalog.

      Install and authorize an integration to discover the resources across your
      organization which support your services.

      Map relevant resources to your services to provide a rich view of
      cataloged services.

      To set up and view a list of all the integrations we support please view
      our
      [documentation](https://developer.konghq.com/service-catalog/integrations/).
  - name: Integration Instances
    description: >
      An integration instance represents a specific account of the integration
      which contains the resources used to manage and support your services.

      Some integrations provide configuration options to customize how it should
      behave once authorized (see the integration's manifest for details).

      Konnect-internal integrations are built-in and do not need to be
      installed.


      Once an integration instance is created, authorize the instance to allow
      the Service Catalog to discover its resources.

      Note that deleting an integration instance is a **destructive** operation.

      When an integration instance is deleted, all its resources and mappings
      will be deleted from the service catalog.

      In cases where the integration instance's credentials need to be updated,
      you may re-authorize the instance to retain all currently discovered
      resources and mappings.

      To set up and view a list of all the integrations we support, please view
      our
      [documentation](https://developer.konghq.com/service-catalog/integrations/).
  - name: Integration Instance Auth Credentials
    description: >
      Represents the credentials use to authorize an integration instance.

      You will want to configure the integration instance settings and
      authorization configuration before authorizing the instance.

      This will inform the authorization process on how to reach and authorize
      the account.

      Once the integration instance is authorized, the system will automatically
      discover all the relevant resources from the account.

      The integration instance's auth credentials can be removed or updated
      while retaining all resources which have already been discovered.
  - name: Integration Instance Auth Config
    description: >
      A integration instance may need to be provided with an auth config before
      authorizing the instance.

      Typically an auth config will be required when authorizing against a
      integration which is hosted within your organization.

      The integration instance's auth config will inform how the Service Catalog
      will authorize the integration instance.

      Note that updating the auth config for an instance which is already
      authorized will **remove the existing credential**, requiring you to
      re-authorize the instance.
  - name: Catalog Resources
    description: >
      Resources are entities discovered from integration instances and are
      intended to be mapped to the relevant services in the catalog.

      Once a resource has been mapped to a service, a rich view of this resource
      will be displayed when viewing your service.


      Any resources which you would like to ignore and hide can be archived.

      Note that archiving a resource will **remove** any mappings it has to
      services in the catalog.


      You can create Resources using only the properties required to identify
      the resource in the third-party system.

      Additional data will be hydrated if the integration that the Resource is
      linked to has been provided with authentication credentials.

      Resources which have not yet been hydrated may still be mapped to a
      Catalog Service.
  - name: Catalog Resource Mappings
    description: >
      Resource mappings represent the link between a resource and a service.

      Once a resource is mapped to a service, a rich view of the resource will
      be presented on the service page.

      A resource may be mapped to multiple services, but it cannot be mapped to
      the same service twice.

      If a resource mapped to a service is later archived, the resource mapping
      will be deleted.

  - name: Event Gateway Backend Clusters
    description: >
      A backend cluster is an abstraction of a real Kafka cluster. It stores the
      connection and configuration details required for Kong Event Gateway to
      proxy traffic to Kafka.


      Multiple Kafka clusters can be proxied through a single Kong Event
      Gateway.
  - name: Event Gateway Virtual Clusters
    description: >
      Virtual clusters are the primary way clients interact with the Event
      Gateway proxy. They allow you to isolate clients from each other when
      connecting to the same backend cluster, and provide each client with
      modified view while still appearing as a standard Kafka cluster.
  - name: Event Gateway Listeners
    description: >
      A listener represents hostname-port or IP-port combinations that connect
      to TCP sockets. Listeners need at least as many ports as backend brokers
      if you use port mapping in a Forward to Virtual Cluster policy. For SNI
      routing, you can route all brokers using a listener with only one port.
      Ports can be expressed as a single port or range. Addresses can be IPv4,
      IPv6, or hostnames.


      A listener can have policies that enforce TLS certificates and perform SNI
      routing. The listener runs at Layer 4 of the network stack. In Kong Event
      Gateway, listeners first take in the connection and then route the TCP
      connection to a virtual cluster based on conditions defined in listener
      policies.
  - name: Event Gateway Listener Policies
    description: >
      Policies control how Kafka protocol traffic is modified between the client

      Consume policies operate on Kafka messages as they are read from a Kafka
      cluster.


      Transformations may be applied at consume time, but they are applied once
      per Consumer. Where possible, transofmrations should be applied as a
      Produce policy

      A certificate object represents a public certificate, and can be

      client/service.

      <br><br>

      Certificates are optionally associated with SNI objects to tie a cert/key
      pair to one or more hostnames.

      If intermediate certificates are required in addition to the main
      certificate, they should be concatenated together into one string.

      Some entities in Kong Gateway share common configuration settings that
      often need to be repeated. For example, multiple plugins that connect to
      Redis may require the same connection settings. Without Partials, you
      would need to replicate this configuration across all plugins. If the
      settings change, you would need to update each plugin individually.
    name: Partials
  - description: >-
      A plugin entity represents a plugin configuration that will be executed
      during the HTTP request/response lifecycle. Plugins let you add
      functionality to services that run behind a Kong Gateway instance, like
      authentication or rate limiting.

      You can find more information about available plugins and which values
      each plugin accepts at the [Plugin
      Hub](https://developer.konghq.com/plugins/).

      <br><br>

      When adding a plugin configuration to a service, the plugin will run on
      every request made by a client to that service. If a plugin needs to be
      tuned to different values for some specific consumers, you can do so by
      creating a separate plugin instance that specifies both the service and
      the consumer, through the service and consumer fields.
    name: Plugins
  - description: >
      Route entities define rules to match client requests. Each route is
      associated with a service, and a service may have multiple routes
      associated to it. Every request matching a given route will be proxied to
      the associated service. You need at least one matching rule that applies
      to the protocol being matched by the route.

      <br><br>

      The combination of routes and services, and the separation of concerns
      between them, offers a powerful routing mechanism with which it is
      possible to define fine-grained entrypoints in Kong Gateway leading to
      different upstream services of your infrastructure.

      <br><br>

      Depending on the protocol, one of the following attributes must be set:

      <br>


      - `http`: At least one of `methods`, `hosts`, `headers`, or `paths`

      - `https`: At least one of `methods`, `hosts`, `headers`, `paths`, or
      `snis`

      - `tcp`: At least one of `sources` or `destinations`

      - `tls`: at least one of `sources`, `destinations`, or `snis`

      - `tls_passthrough`: set `snis`

      - `grpc`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, or `paths`

      - `grpcs`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, `paths`, or `snis`

      - `ws`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, or `paths`

      - `wss`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, `paths`, or `snis`



        <br>
        A route can't have both `tls` and `tls_passthrough` protocols at same time.

      An SNI object represents a many-to-one mapping of hostnames to a
      certificate.

      <br><br>

      A certificate object can have many hostnames associated with it. When Kong
      Gateway receives an SSL request, it uses the SNI field in the Client Hello
      to look up the certificate object based on the SNI associated with the
      certificate.

      Service entities are abstractions of your microservice interfaces or
      formal APIs. For example, a service could be a data transformation
      microservice or a billing API.

      <br><br>

      The main attribute of a service is the destination URL for proxying
      traffic. This URL can be set as a single string or by specifying its
      protocol, host, port and path individually.

      <br><br>

      Services are associated to routes, and a single service can have many
      routes associated with it. Routes are entrypoints in Kong Gateway which
      define rules to match client requests. Once a route is matched, Kong
      Gateway proxies the request to its associated service. See the [Route
      documentation](https://developer.konghq.com/gateway/entities/route/) for a
      detailed explanation of how Kong proxies traffic.

      A target is an IP address or hostname with a port that identifies an

      the targets can be dynamically added, modified, or deleted. Changes take
      effect on the fly.

      <br><br>

      To disable a target, post a new one with `weight=0`, or use the `DELETE`
      method to accomplish the same.
    name: Targets

      The upstream object represents a virtual hostname and can be used to load

      An upstream also includes a [health
      checker](https://developer.konghq.com/gateway/traffic-control/health-checks-circuit-breakers/),
      which can enable and disable targets based on their ability or inability
      to serve requests.

      The configuration for the health checker is stored in the upstream object,
      and applies to all of its targets.

      Vault objects are used to configure different vault connectors for
      [managing
      secrets](https://developer.konghq.com/gateway/secrets-management/).

      Configuring a vault lets you reference secrets from other entities.

      This allows for a proper separation of secrets and configuration and
      prevents secret sprawl.

      <br><br>

      For example, you could store a certificate and a key in a vault, then
      reference them from a certificate entity. This way, the certificate and
      key are not stored in the entity directly and are more secure.

      <br><br>

      Secrets rotation can be managed using

        Auth credentials are singleton resources that have a 1-to-1 relationship
        with

        an integration instance.


        An attempt to create subsequent auth credentials for an instance will
        result in a 409 response.

      summary: List Integrations
      description: >
        Returns a paginated collection of all catalog integrations available to
        connect.

        Each integration represents a built-in connector that extends the
        platform's capabilities;

        enabling discovery, resource management, event ingestion, and more.

        Integrations expose metadata that describes how they authenticate, what
        configuration they

        require, and how they interact with catalog entities like Resources and
        Services.


        Currently, integrations are platform-defined and cannot be extend or
        registered by customers.

        This api allows the user to move a document within the document tree
        using the parameters parent_document_id and index. If parent_document_id
        is not provided, the document will be placed at the top level of the
        document tree. index represents a zero-indexed document order relative
        to its siblings under the same parent. For example, if we want to put
        the document at top level in first position we would send
        parent_document_id: null and index: 0. This api also supports using a
        negative index to count backwards from the end of the document list,
        which means you can put the document in last position by using index:
        -1.

        represents a zero-indexed page order relative to its siblings under the

        first position we would send parent_page_id: null and index: 0. This api
        also supports using a negative index to count backwards from the end of

        using index: -1.

        The slug of a page in a portal, used to compute its full URL path within

        When a page has a `parent_page_id`, its full path is built by joining
        the parent’s slug with its own. 

        For example, if a parent page has the slug `slug1` and this page’s slug
        is `slug2`, the resulting path will be `/slug1/slug2`. 

        This enables nested page structures like `/slug1/slug2/slug3`.

        type for API spec contents.

        In this role, the integration becomes the source of truth for the spec.

        When a spec is attached to a Catalog Service using this source type, the
        platform relies on the external system to provide and update the spec
        data.

        The configuration to forward request to `destination` and rewrite ports
        accordingly.

        All broker ids must fit in the range of ports defined in the listener,
        if it doesn't the metadata request will

        return an error.


        For example with ports: [9000, "9092-9094", "9100"] and `bootstrap_port:
        at_start` and brokers with ids

        1, 2, 3, 4 we will map: bootstrap to 9000 broker 1 to 9001, broker 2 to
        9002, broker 3 to 9003, and broker 4

        to 9004 and fail the metadata request as these ports are not open.


        However, with the same configuration but with brokers with ids:
        92,93,94,100 we will map: bootstrap to 9000,

        broker 92 to 9092, broker 93 to 9093, broker 94 to 9094, and broker 100
        to 9100.


        In most cases users should use a single range `["9090-9094"] ` and
        `bootstrap_port: at_start` and connect with

        `<host>:9090` as bootstrap server. Being able to use multiple ranges is
        only useful when when dealing with

        gaps in broker ids.


        It is strongly discouraged to use port mapping in production.

            It provides a stable endpoint to use as the bootstrap server for
            clients, regardless of broker

            IDs in the cluster.


            Additionally, it offsets all ports by one, so for example, if there
            are 3 brokers (id=1, id=2, id=3)

            then we will use 4 ports: 9092 (bootstrap), 9093 (id=1), 9094
            (id=2), 9095 (id=3)

            With `none` we will use 3 ports: 9092 (id=1), 9093 (id=2), 9094
            (id=3).

            This suffix is concatenated with the virtual cluster "dns.label"
            label to form the base name for the SNI.

            If not provided, the virtual cluster "dns.label" label alone is used
            as the base name for the SNI.

            For example with sni_suffix: `.example.com` and virtual cluster
            "dns.label" label: `my-cluster`,

            the SNI suffix for it is `my-cluster.example.com`.

            If "dns.label" label is absent on the virtual cluster, the traffic
            won't be routed there.


            The bootstrap host is `bootstrap.my-cluster.example.com` and then
            each broker is addressable at `broker-0.my-cluster.example.com`,
            `broker-1.my-cluster.example.com`, etc.

            This means that your deployment needs to have a wildcard certificate
            for the domain and a DNS resolver that routes
            `*.my-cluster.example.com` to the proxy.


            The accepted format is a DNS subdomain starting with either `.` or
            `-`. For example, `-keg.example.com`, `.keg.example.com`,
            `.namespace.svc.cluster.local`, and `.localhost` are all valid,

      description: >-
        A Plugin entity represents a plugin configuration that will be executed
        during the HTTP request/response lifecycle. It is how you can add
        functionalities to Services that run behind Kong, like Authentication or
        Rate Limiting for example. You can find more information about how to
        install and what values each plugin takes by visiting the [Kong
        Hub](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/). When adding a Plugin Configuration
        to a Service, every request made by a client to that Service will run
        said Plugin. If a Plugin needs to be tuned to different values for some
        specific Consumers, you can do so by creating a separate plugin instance
        that specifies both the Service and the Consumer, through the `service`
        and `consumer` fields.

        to its associated Service. The combination of Routes and Services (and
        the separation of concerns between them) offers a powerful routing
        mechanism with which it is possible to define fine-grained entry-points

        Service entities, as the name implies, are abstractions of each of your
        own upstream services. Examples of Services would be a data
        transformation microservice, a billing API, etc. The main attribute of a
        Service is its URL (where Kong should proxy traffic to), which can be
        set as a single string or by specifying its `protocol`, `host`, `port`
        and `path` individually. Services are associated to Routes (a Service
        can have many Routes associated with it). Routes are entry-points in
        Kong and define rules to match client requests. Once a Route is matched,
        Kong proxies the request to its associated Service. See the [Proxy
        Reference][proxy-reference] for a detailed explanation of how Kong
        proxies traffic.

        Examples of Vaults are Environment Variables, Hashicorp Vault and AWS

        other entities. For example a certificate entity can store a reference
        to a certificate and key, stored in a vault, instead of storing the
        certificate and key within the entity. This allows a proper separation
