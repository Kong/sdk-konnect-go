This SDK is generated from [openapi.yaml](https://github.com/Kong/sdk-konnect-go/blob/main/openapi.yaml) using [Speakeasy](https://speakeasyapi.dev). It is a work in progress, and should not be depended as there **will** be breaking changes.

`openapi.yaml` is generated from `platform-api`. It uses `./tools/gen_go_sdk.sh` on the `bootstrap-go-sdk` branch. Do not edit `openapi.yaml` manually as it will be overwritten.

If you need access to Speakeasy to generate the, ask @mheap to add you to the list of users (until we implement `workflow_dispatch` on this repo).
